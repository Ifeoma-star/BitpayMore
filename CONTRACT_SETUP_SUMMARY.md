## üìã Contract Authorization Requirements

### Critical: These 3 Contracts MUST Be Authorized

| Contract | Why Needed | Impact if Missing |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **bitpay-core** | Vault access, stream operations | ‚ùå Withdrawals fail, cancellations fail |
| **bitpay-marketplace** | NFT sales, stream updates | ‚ùå Purchases fail, transfers fail |
| **bitpay-treasury** | Multi-sig withdrawals | ‚ùå Treasury withdrawals fail |

**Authorization command:**
```bash
./contract/scripts/authorize-contracts.sh
```

**Verification:**
```clarity
(contract-call? .bitpay-access-control is-authorized-contract .bitpay-core)
;; Expected: true
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Summary

```
bitpay-access-control (Root Authority)
    ‚Üì authorizes
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bitpay-core (Streaming)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bitpay-marketplace (NFT Sales)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bitpay-treasury (Multi-Sig)
           ‚Üì all use
    bitpay-sbtc-helper (Vault Manager)
           ‚Üì manages
    sBTC Vault (Locked Funds)
```

**Key Points:**
- Access-control is the root authority
- 3 contracts need authorization to work
- All vault access goes through sbtc-helper
- Treasury uses 3-of-5 multi-sig with 24h timelock

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Concepts

### 1. Authorization is NOT Optional
**The protocol will not work without proper authorization.**

After deployment:
```bash
./contract/scripts/authorize-contracts.sh
```

**Missing this step causes:**
- Withdrawals fail with ERR_UNAUTHORIZED
- Marketplace purchases fail
- Treasury operations fail
- Stream cancellations fail

### 2. Multi-Sig is Required for Treasury
**All treasury withdrawals need 3-of-5 admin approvals + 24h wait**

Configuration:
- 5 total admins
- 3 approvals minimum
- 24-hour timelock (144 blocks)
- 100 sBTC daily limit
- 7-day proposal expiry

### 3. Two Types of NFTs

| NFT Type | Purpose | Transferable | Owner |
|----------|---------|--------------|-------|
| Recipient NFT | Proof of receipt | ‚ùå No (soul-bound) | Recipient |
| Obligation NFT | Payment right | ‚úÖ Yes (tradeable) | Sender |

### 4. Two Purchase Methods

**Direct (on-chain):** One atomic transaction
```clarity
(contract-call? .bitpay-marketplace buy-nft <stream-id>)
```

**Gateway (credit card):** Two-step process
```clarity
;; Step 1: Buyer initiates
(contract-call? .bitpay-marketplace initiate-purchase <stream-id> <payment-id>)

;; Step 2: Backend completes (after payment confirmed)
(contract-call? .bitpay-marketplace complete-purchase <stream-id> <buyer> <payment-id>)
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: "ERR_UNAUTHORIZED (u200)"
**Cause:** Contract not authorized

**Fix:**
```bash
./contract/scripts/authorize-contracts.sh
```

**Verify:**
```clarity
(contract-call? .bitpay-access-control is-authorized-contract .bitpay-core)
```

### Issue: Multi-sig withdrawal fails
**Causes:**
- Less than 3 approvals
- Timelock not elapsed (need 24 hours)
- Proposal expired (max 7 days)
- Daily limit exceeded

**Fix:** Check proposal status and wait for requirements

### Issue: Verification tests failing
**Fix:** Run scripts in order:
```bash
./contract/scripts/authorize-contracts.sh
./contract/scripts/setup-multisig-admins.sh
./contract/scripts/verify-authorizations.sh
```
