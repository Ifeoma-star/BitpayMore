# BitPay: Bitcoin Streaming & Vesting Vaults

## Problem Statement

While Bitcoin and Stacks are growing with active users and developers, the payment infrastructure remains broken. Workers wait 30 days for earned money, freelancers risk unpaid work, and traditional payment rails misalign incentives with infrequent lump sums.

For example, when I talked to my friend who streams games daily, he explained how he earns content every day but waits weeks for payouts. Platforms like Twitch take 50% and delay payments for 15-60 days. He showed me his earnings dashboard - watching money pile up that he can't access.

Bitcoin was designed to be peer-to-peer electronic cash, but there's no native way to stream payments per-second. Ethereum has $1.5B+ locked in streaming protocols (DefiLlama), but Bitcoin has zero native streaming infrastructure.

When I mentioned the idea of a platform where Bitcoin could flow like Netflix streams video - continuous, per-second payments secured by smart contracts - he immediately got it. "That's what we need," he said.

This highlights a clear gap in Bitcoin's utility. Making payments continuous and trust-minimized can unlock real economic activity, stronger financial relationships, and a more functional Bitcoin economy.

## Solution

BitPay is a streaming payment protocol that lets Bitcoin flow continuously per-second through smart contracts - turning payment moments into payment relationships.

It has a clean, intuitive design and lets users lock sBTC in vaults that vest funds continuously to recipients. With features like instant withdrawals, cancellation options, tradeable stream NFTs, and a marketplace, BitPay makes programmable money simple.

It helps users build financial trust, gain real-time access to earned funds, and create new economic models. BitPay also brings multiple use cases - payroll, freelance payments, vesting schedules, subscriptions, and DAO treasuries - together on Bitcoin, making it the Netflix for money.

## Value Proposition: Why This Matters & What Makes It Unique

**Why This Matters:**
- **$800B+ global payroll** and **$1.5T+ freelance economy** run on broken payment rails
- Workers wait 30 days for earned money while employers hold funds in trust-based systems

## Impact Potential: Potential Adoption & How It Can Scale

BitPay has the potential to become a fundamental primitive for the Bitcoin economy by solving one of its biggest limitations - static, trust-based payments.

It turns financial relationships into continuous streams secured by code, keeping both parties aligned and engaged.

What makes it even more powerful is that every stream doesn't just move money - it creates programmable economic relationships. This means users don't just send payments; they build financial infrastructure.

**Potential Adoption:**
- **$1.5T global freelance market** - replace risky trust-based contracts with guaranteed streams
- **$800B payroll market** - employees access earned wages per-second instead of monthly waits
- **$1.5B+ Ethereum streaming users** - ready to migrate for Bitcoin's security and finality
- **DAO treasuries** - automated, accountable fund distribution without multisig delays

**How It Scales:**
With composable smart contracts, BitPay becomes infrastructure others build on:
- **Payroll apps** use streaming vaults for employee payments
- **Freelance platforms** integrate guaranteed payment streams
- **Subscription services** leverage continuous revenue flows
- **Investment DAOs** create vesting schedules for members
- **Content platforms** stream micropayments to creators

By providing the rails for continuous finance, BitPay creates network effects - every new use case strengthens the ecosystem, driving real adoption, on-chain activity, and long-term Bitcoin utility.

## Bitcoin & Stacks Alignment: How BitPay Drives Value

**Increases Bitcoin Utility:**
BitPay helps people move beyond holding BTC - they'll use it actively in real economic relationships through streaming payments.

This brings real liquidity into productive use cases: payroll, vesting, subscriptions, and continuous value exchange. Bitcoin becomes programmable cash, not just a store of value.

**Increases Stacks Adoption:**
BitPay showcases why Stacks matters: **Clarity's safety guarantees** are perfect for financial contracts where bugs mean lost funds.

Users don't just learn about Stacks - they use it for real economic activity:
- Lock sBTC in vaults
- Stream payments per-second
- Trade future income as NFTs
- Build businesses on trust-minimized infrastructure

**More transactions, more active wallets, higher retention** - all driven by real utility.

By turning Bitcoin curiosity into actual continuous payments on Stacks, BitPay helps both ecosystems grow - increasing value for developers, BTC holders, workers, businesses, and the broader Bitcoin economy.
