## Stacks Hackathon Presentation (4 Minutes Max)

## 🐦 TWITTER PITCH

**"LinkedIn for on-chain reputation. Kickstarter for Bitcoin apps."**

BitPay brings continuous money streams to Bitcoin—enabling programmable payroll, vesting, and subscriptions powered by sBTC. Netflix for money, secured by Bitcoin.

## 📋 PROBLEM STATEMENT

### Start with the "why" — clearly explain why this problem matters

**Traditional payments are broken.**

💔 **Real User Pain Point:**
- Freelancers work for months and risk not getting paid
- Startups pay employees monthly, creating cash flow anxiety
- Investors vest tokens but can't access early liquidity
- Contractors receive lump sums with no accountability

📊 **Evidence & Trends:**
- $1.5B+ locked in payment streaming protocols on Ethereum (Sablier, Superfluid)
- 60% of freelancers report late or missing payments
- Vesting schedules worth billions require manual execution
- Growing demand for continuous finance in DeFi

🧑 **Be Human:**
Imagine working 80 hours on a project, trusting you'll get paid at the end—and they ghost you. Or getting a $50K salary once per year instead of steady income. Financial relationships need continuous trust, not just promises.

## 💡 SOLUTION

### Be Clear — Clearly articulate a solution to the problem

**BitPay: Programmable Money Streams on Bitcoin**

💡 **Your "Aha!" Moment:**
> "What if money could flow like water from a tap—continuous, controllable, and unstoppable once locked?"

**What BitPay Does (In Plain Language):**
- Lock sBTC in a smart contract vault
- Money streams continuously per-second to recipients
- Recipients withdraw anytime—only vested amount
- Senders cancel anytime—unvested funds returned

**How It Solves The Problem Better:**

1. **Trust Without Intermediaries**
   - Smart contracts guarantee payment—no escrow needed
   - Both parties protected: sender keeps control, recipient gets security

2. **Continuous Cash Flow**
   - Employees earn salary every second, not monthly
   - Contractors get paid for work completed, not promises

3. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Cancel bad actors mid-stream, recover unvested funds
   - No more "pay upfront and hope" or "work and pray"

4. **Built on Bitcoin**
   - sBTC means Bitcoin-native settlements
   - Secured by Bitcoin's $1T+ network
   - First streaming protocol on Bitcoin (not just Ethereum clones)

🎯 **Key Outcome & Impact:**
- **Faster:** Get paid per-second, not per-month
- **Safer:** Smart contracts eliminate trust risk
- **Cheaper:** No escrow agents or legal contracts needed
- **More Flexible:** Stream, pause, cancel, or modify payments

👥 **Connect Back To The User:**
> "For freelancers, BitPay means getting paid for every hour worked—guaranteed. For startups, it means attracting talent with continuous salaries. Our solution helps everyone by turning payment moments into payment relationships."

### The Final Message

**"We didn't build a hackathon project. We built the future."**

BitPay is the first programmable cash flow primitive on Bitcoin. It's not just about streaming payments—it's about creating entirely new financial relationships that are:

- **Trustless** — Smart contracts, not promises
- **Continuous** — Money flows like water
- **Composable** — Building blocks for 1000s of apps
- **Bitcoin-Native** — Secured by the world's most secure network

**This is the missing piece that unlocks the Bitcoin economy.**

We're not asking: "Can we build this?"
We're declaring: "This is what Bitcoin-based finance looks like."

**The demo you just saw is live. The contracts are deployed. The future is here.**
