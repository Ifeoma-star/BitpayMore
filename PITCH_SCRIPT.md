# BitPay 5-Minute Pitch Script
**Target: 3 minutes pitch + 2 minutes demo**

---

## Slide 1: Title (10 seconds)
"Hi everyone! I'm presenting **BitPay** - Bitcoin Streaming and Vesting Vaults.

We're building **Netflix for Money, secured by Bitcoin**."

---

## Slide 2: Twitter Pitch (15 seconds)
"Imagine if your salary streamed into your wallet **per-second** instead of waiting 30 days.

BitPay makes Bitcoin flow continuously through smart contracts - **guaranteed payments, no trust needed**."

---

## Slide 3: Problem Statement (30 seconds)
"Here's the problem: **$2.3 trillion in payroll and freelance markets run on broken payment systems**.

My friend streams games every day - earns content daily, but waits **weeks for payouts**. Twitch takes 50%, delays payments 15-60 days.

Workers wait 30 days for salaries they've already earned. Freelancers risk unpaid work.

Meanwhile, Ethereum has **$1.5 billion locked in streaming protocols**. Bitcoin? **Zero native streaming infrastructure**.

You work every day, but your employer holds YOUR money for 30 days. Imagine if Netflix charged you upfront for the whole year - that's what employers do with your salary."

---

## Slide 4: Solution (25 seconds)
"BitPay solves this with **per-second Bitcoin streaming**.

Lock sBTC in smart contract vaults. Money streams continuously to recipients. They withdraw anytime. Sender can cancel and recover unvested funds.

It's **trust-minimized, continuous, and flexible** - turning payment moments into payment relationships."

---

## Slide 5: How It Works (20 seconds)
"Four simple steps:

**Lock sBTC** - Sender locks Bitcoin in a smart contract vault

**Money Streams** - Funds vest continuously per-second to recipient

**Withdraw Anytime** - Recipient claims vested amount whenever needed

**Cancel Option** - Sender can cancel, recovers unvested funds

Trust-minimized. Continuous. Flexible."

---

## Slide 6: Let's See It Live (5 seconds)
"Let me show you how it actually works."

## Slide 7: Proposition (40 seconds)
"Here's why this matters:

**Value Prop**: We're the **first streaming protocol on Bitcoin**. Real sBTC utility beyond speculation. Guaranteed payments in code, not trust.

**Impact Potential**: $1.5 trillion freelance market, $800 billion payroll market ready for this. We're a **composable primitive** - others build payroll apps, subscription services, DAO treasuries on top of us. Network effects.

**Bitcoin & Stacks Alignment**: We increase Bitcoin utility - people don't just hold BTC, they **use it** for continuous payments.

For Stacks, we showcase why **Clarity's safety guarantees** matter for financial contracts. More transactions, more active wallets, real adoption driven by utility."

---

## Slide 8: Team & Thank You (15 seconds)
"We built a **production-ready protocol with 7 smart contracts, live on testnet right now**.

## Demo Script (2 minutes)

### On Dashboard (30 seconds)
"Here's our dashboard. I can create a stream - let's say I want to pay a developer.

I lock 1000 sBTC, set the vesting period - maybe 30 days. The smart contract locks the funds."

### Show Stream Page (30 seconds)
"Now watch this - the stream is **vesting per-second in real-time**.

The recipient sees exactly how much they've earned **right now**, not in 30 days. They can withdraw anytime - it's their money.

If I need to cancel? I can stop the stream and recover what hasn't vested yet. Fair for both sides."

### Show Marketplace (30 seconds)
"Here's something unique - **streams become tradeable NFTs**.

The recipient can sell their future income on our marketplace. Need cash now instead of waiting? Sell your stream.

This turns future earnings into liquid assets."

### Wrap Up (30 seconds)
"Everything you see is **live on testnet right now**. Seven smart contracts. Real-time WebSocket updates. Production-ready.

We're not just streaming payments - we're building **infrastructure for the Bitcoin economy**."

## Key Points to Emphasize:
‚úÖ **Problem is relatable** - 30-day salary waits, game streamer friend story
‚úÖ **Solution is simple** - Netflix for money, per-second streaming
‚úÖ **We're first on Bitcoin** - $1.5B on Ethereum, zero on Bitcoin until now
‚úÖ **Production-ready** - Live on testnet, 7 contracts, real demo
‚úÖ **Composable primitive** - Others build on us = network effects

## What NOT to Say:
‚ùå Don't say "we will win" or "this will be huge"
‚ùå Don't get technical about Clarity syntax
‚ùå Don't explain every smart contract
‚ùå Don't rush - pause for emphasis

## Delivery Tips:
üí° **Slide 3 (Problem)** - This is your hook. Make it personal with the game streamer story
üí° **Slide 5 (How It Works)** - Point to each step, don't just read
üí° **Slide 7 (Proposition)** - Emphasize "composable primitive" - others build on us
üí° **Demo** - Let them SEE the per-second vesting, don't just talk about it
