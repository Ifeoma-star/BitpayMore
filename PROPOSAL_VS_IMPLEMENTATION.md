# BitPay Proposal vs Implementation - Complete Comparison

## Executive Summary

**Project Name**: BitPay (was "BitFlow" in proposal)
**Status**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - All core features from proposal are built and working

---

## Chapter 3: User Stories & Features - IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### 3.1 Epic: Stream Management ✅ COMPLETE

#### **US-1: Create Stream** ✅
**Proposal**: _"As a Sender, I want to create a new stream by locking sBTC, so I can continuously pay a recipient over time."_

**Implementation**:
- ✅ **Contract**: `bitpay-core.clar` → `create-stream` function (lines 63-132)
- ✅ **Frontend Hook**: `useCreateStream()` in [hooks/use-bitpay-write.ts](bitpay-frontend/hooks/use-bitpay-write.ts:26)
- ✅ **UI Pages**:
  - Single creation: `/dashboard/streams/create`
  - Bulk creation: `/dashboard/bulk` with CSV upload
  - Template-based: `/dashboard/templates` → Use Template button
- ✅ **Features**:
  - Recipient address input
  - Amount in sBTC (with conversion to sats)
  - Start block height
  - End block height
  - sBTC locked in vault via `bitpay-sbtc-helper.clar`
  - Post-conditions for security

**How it works**:
```clarity
(define-public (create-stream
  (recipient principal)
  (amount uint)
  (start-block uint)
  (end-block uint))
  ;; Locks sBTC in vault
  ;; Creates stream record
  ;; Emits stream-created event
)
```

---

#### **US-2: Cancel Stream** ✅
**Proposal**: _"As a Sender, I want to cancel an active stream I created, so I can stop the flow of funds and recover the unvested amount."_

**Implementation**:
- ✅ **Contract**: `bitpay-core.clar` → `cancel-stream` function (lines 174-226)
- ✅ **Frontend Hook**: `useCancelStream()` in [hooks/use-bitpay-write.ts](bitpay-frontend/hooks/use-bitpay-write.ts:124)
- ✅ **UI**:
  - `/dashboard/streams` - Cancel button on each stream card
  - `/dashboard/streams/[id]` - Cancel Stream button on detail page
- ✅ **Logic**:
  - Calculates vested vs unvested amounts
  - Returns unvested sBTC to sender
  - Transfers vested amount to recipient
  - Marks stream as cancelled
  - Records cancellation block height

**How it works**:
```clarity
(define-public (cancel-stream (stream-id uint))
  ;; Calculate vested amount at current block
  ;; Calculate unvested (remaining) amount
  ;; Transfer unvested → sender
  ;; Transfer vested → recipient
  ;; Mark cancelled
)
```

---

#### **US-3: Withdraw Funds** ✅
**Proposal**: _"As a Recipient, I want to withdraw the accrued funds from my streams at any time, so I can access my money without waiting."_

**Implementation**:
- ✅ **Contract**: `bitpay-core.clar` → `withdraw-from-stream` function (lines 137-169)
- ✅ **Frontend Hook**: `useWithdrawFromStream()` in [hooks/use-bitpay-write.ts](bitpay-frontend/hooks/use-bitpay-write.ts:69)
- ✅ **UI**:
  - `/dashboard/streams` - Withdraw button (only shows if user is recipient)
  - `/dashboard/streams/[id]` - Prominent withdraw button with available amount
  - Dashboard overview shows "Available to Withdraw" stat
- ✅ **Real-time Calculation**:
  - Vested amount calculated based on current block height
  - Shows withdrawable amount (vested - already withdrawn)
  - Updates every 30 seconds via block height polling

**How it works**:
```clarity
(define-public (withdraw-from-stream (stream-id uint))
  ;; Get vested amount at current block
  ;; Subtract already withdrawn
  ;; Transfer available amount to recipient
  ;; Update withdrawn field
)
```

---

### 3.2 Epic: Transparency & Viewing ✅ COMPLETE

#### **US-4: View All Streams** ✅
**Proposal**: _"As a User, I want to view a list of all streams I'm involved in (as sender or recipient), so I can manage my finances."_

**Implementation**:
- ✅ **Contract Functions**:
  - `get-sender-streams` (line 241)
  - `get-recipient-streams` (line 248)
  - `get-stream` (line 234)
- ✅ **Frontend Hook**: `useUserStreams()` in [hooks/use-bitpay-read.ts](bitpay-frontend/hooks/use-bitpay-read.ts:138)
- ✅ **UI Pages**:
  - `/dashboard` - Overview with recent streams
  - `/dashboard/streams` - Full list with tabs:
    - All (total count)
    - Active streams
    - Completed streams
    - Pending streams
    - Cancelled streams
- ✅ **Features**:
  - Search by address or stream ID
  - Filter by status
  - Real-time updates
  - Shows role (sender/recipient)
  - Progress bars for each stream

**How it works**:
1. Frontend calls `get-sender-streams(user-address)` → returns list of stream IDs
2. Frontend calls `get-recipient-streams(user-address)` → returns list of stream IDs
3. Combines both lists, removes duplicates
4. Fetches full details for each stream ID
5. Enriches with calculated vested/withdrawable amounts
6. Displays in filterable/searchable UI

---

#### **US-5: See Vested Amount** ✅
**Proposal**: _"As a User, I want to see exactly how much sBTC is available to withdraw from a stream at the current moment, so I can make informed decisions."_

**Implementation**:
- ✅ **Contract Functions**:
  - `get-vested-amount-at-block` (lines 256-283) - Core vesting logic
  - `get-vested-amount` (line 288) - Current block wrapper
  - `get-withdrawable-amount` (line 295) - Available to withdraw
- ✅ **Frontend Utilities**:
  - `calculateVestedAmount()` in [lib/contracts/config.ts](bitpay-frontend/lib/contracts/config.ts:158)
  - `calculateWithdrawableAmount()` in [lib/contracts/config.ts](bitpay-frontend/lib/contracts/config.ts:169)
  - `calculateProgress()` in [lib/contracts/config.ts](bitpay-frontend/lib/contracts/config.ts:177)
- ✅ **UI Display**:
  - Every stream card shows 4 amounts:
    1. Total Amount
    2. Vested Amount (green/teal)
    3. Withdrawn Amount
    4. Available (pink - this is withdrawable)
  - Progress bar shows vesting percentage
  - Updates in real-time (30-second polling)

**Vesting Formula** (Linear):
```clarity
;; If before start → 0
;; If after end → total amount
;; During stream:
vested = (current-block - start-block) * total-amount / (end-block - start-block)
withdrawable = vested - withdrawn
```

---

### 3.3 Epic: sBTC Integration ✅ COMPLETE

#### **US-6: Use sBTC Directly** ✅
**Proposal**: _"As a User, I want to use sBTC directly from my wallet to create streams, so I can use native Bitcoin value without wrapping."_

**Implementation**:
- ✅ **Contract**: `bitpay-sbtc-helper.clar` - sBTC wrapper contract
  - `transfer-to-vault` - Locks sBTC when creating stream
  - `transfer-from-vault` - Releases sBTC for withdrawals/cancellations
  - `get-vault-balance` - Check total locked sBTC
- ✅ **sBTC Token Integration**:
  - Contract address configured in [lib/contracts/config.ts](bitpay-frontend/lib/contracts/config.ts:20)
  - Uses SIP-010 fungible token trait
  - Post-conditions ensure sBTC transfers
- ✅ **Frontend**:
  - Wallet connection via Hiro/Xverse (existing `walletService`)
  - Amount input in sBTC (user-friendly)
  - Converted to micro-sBTC (sats) for contract calls
  - Post-conditions prevent unauthorized transfers

**How sBTC flows**:
```
Create Stream:
  User Wallet → (sBTC) → bitpay-sbtc-helper vault

Withdraw:
  bitpay-sbtc-helper vault → (sBTC) → Recipient Wallet

Cancel:
  bitpay-sbtc-helper vault → (unvested sBTC) → Sender Wallet
  bitpay-sbtc-helper vault → (vested sBTC) → Recipient Wallet
```

## Chapter 5: Protocol Deep Dive - IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION

### 5.1 Linear Vesting Formula ✅ CORRECT

**Contract Implementation**:
```clarity
(define-read-only (get-vested-amount-at-block
  (stream-id uint)
  (block-height-value uint))
  (match (map-get? streams stream-id)
    stream (let (
      (start (get start-block stream))
      (end (get end-block stream))
      (amount (get amount stream))
      (duration (- end start))
    )
      (if (< block-height-value start)
        u0  ;; Before start → nothing vested
        (if (or (>= block-height-value end) (get cancelled stream))
          amount  ;; After end → everything vested
          (let ((elapsed (- block-height-value start)))
            (/ (* amount elapsed) duration)  ;; Linear vesting
          )
        )
      )
    )
    u0
  )
)
```

**Frontend mirrors this**:
```typescript
export const calculateVestedAmount = (
  stream: StreamData,
  currentBlock: bigint
): bigint => {
  const { amount, 'start-block': startBlock, 'end-block': endBlock, cancelled } = stream;

  if (currentBlock < startBlock) return BigInt(0);
  if (currentBlock >= endBlock || cancelled) return amount;

  const elapsed = currentBlock - startBlock;
  const duration = endBlock - startBlock;
  return (amount * elapsed) / duration;
};
```

✅ **MATCHES PROPOSAL EXACTLY**

---

### 5.2 Event-Driven Architecture ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Proposal mentioned** real-time updates and monitoring.

**Implementation**:
- ✅ Contract emits 3 event types:
  ```clarity
  (print {event: "stream-created", ...})
  (print {event: "stream-withdrawal", ...})
  (print {event: "stream-cancelled", ...})
  ```
- ✅ Chainhook configuration: [chainhook-config.json](chainhook-config.json:1)
- ✅ Webhook handler: [/api/webhooks/chainhook](bitpay-frontend/app/api/webhooks/chainhook/route.ts:1)
- ✅ Reorg handling built-in
- ✅ Setup documentation: [CHAINHOOK_SETUP.md](CHAINHOOK_SETUP.md:1)

**Flow**:
```
User creates stream
  ↓
Contract emits "stream-created" event
  ↓
Chainhook detects event
  ↓
Sends POST to /api/webhooks/chainhook
  ↓
Webhook processes event
  ↓
(Future: Trigger real-time UI update via WebSocket/Pusher)
```
