## Contract 1: bitpay-core

The **heart of BitPay**. Manages all streaming payment logic including creation, withdrawals, and cancellations.

### Data Structures

```clarity
;; Stream data map
(define-map streams
  { stream-id: uint }
  {
    sender: principal,
    recipient: principal,
    amount: uint,
    start-block: uint,
    end-block: uint,
    withdrawn: uint,
    cancelled: bool,
    cancelled-at-block: (optional uint)
  }
)

;; Stream counter
(define-data-var stream-id-nonce uint u0)

;; Fee configuration
(define-data-var fee-basis-points uint u10) ;; 0.1% default
```

### Core Functions

#### 1. create-stream

Creates a new payment stream by locking sBTC in the contract.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Sender
    participant Core as bitpay-core
    participant Helper as sbtc-helper
    participant NFT as obligation-nft
    participant Treasury

    Sender->>Core: create-stream(recipient, amount, start, end)

    Core->>Core: Validate parameters
    Note over Core: Check amount > 0<br/>Check end > start<br/>Check recipient != sender

    Core->>Helper: transfer-sbtc(sender, contract, amount)
    Helper-->>Core: Success

    Core->>Core: Calculate & deduct fee
    Core->>Treasury: transfer-fee(fee-amount)

    Core->>Core: Increment stream-id-nonce
    Core->>Core: Store stream data

    Core->>NFT: mint(recipient, stream-id)
    NFT-->>Core: NFT minted

    Core-->>Sender: stream-id
```

**Parameters:**
- `recipient` (principal) - Stream recipient address
- `amount` (uint) - Total sBTC amount in satoshis
- `start-block` (uint) - Starting block height
- `end-block` (uint) - Ending block height

**Returns:** `(response uint uint)` - Stream ID or error code

**Errors:**
- `err-invalid-amount` (u100)
- `err-invalid-duration` (u101)
- `err-transfer-failed` (u102)
- `err-same-sender-recipient` (u103)

#### 2. withdraw-from-stream

Allows recipient to withdraw vested amount from a stream.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[withdraw-from-stream] --> B{Stream exists?}
    B -->|No| C[err-stream-not-found]
    B -->|Yes| D{Caller is recipient?}

    D -->|No| E[err-not-recipient]
    D -->|Yes| F[Get current block]

    F --> G[Calculate vested amount]
    G --> H{Amount > 0?}

    H -->|No| I[err-nothing-to-withdraw]
    H -->|Yes| J[Update withdrawn amount]

    J --> K[Transfer sBTC to recipient]
    K --> L{Transfer success?}

    L -->|No| M[err-transfer-failed]
    L -->|Yes| N[Return withdrawn amount]

    style A fill:#e1f5ff
    style G fill:#ffe1e1
    style K fill:#e1ffe1
    style N fill:#d4f4dd
```

**Vesting Calculation:**

```clarity
(define-read-only (get-withdrawable-amount (stream-id uint))
  (let ((stream (unwrap! (map-get? streams {stream-id: stream-id}) err-stream-not-found))
        (current-block block-height)
        (elapsed (if (get cancelled stream)
                    (default-to u0 (get cancelled-at-block stream))
                    (if (> current-block (get end-block stream))
                        (get end-block stream)
                        current-block))))
    (let ((total-vested (/ (* (get amount stream)
                              (- elapsed (get start-block stream)))
                           (- (get end-block stream) (get start-block stream)))))
      (ok (- total-vested (get withdrawn stream))))))
```

**Formula:**
```
vested_amount = (total_amount Ã— elapsed_blocks) / total_duration_blocks
withdrawable = vested_amount - already_withdrawn
```

#### 3. cancel-stream

Cancels an active stream, returning unvested funds to sender.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Sender
    participant Core as bitpay-core
    participant Helper as sbtc-helper
    participant NFT as bitpay-nft

    Sender->>Core: cancel-stream(stream-id)

    Core->>Core: Verify sender
    Note over Core: Check caller == stream.sender<br/>Check not already cancelled

    Core->>Core: Calculate vested & unvested
    Note over Core: vested = withdrawable by recipient<br/>unvested = returnable to sender

    Core->>Core: Mark stream as cancelled
    Core->>Core: Set cancelled-at-block

    alt Unvested > 0
        Core->>Helper: transfer(contract, sender, unvested)
        Helper-->>Core: Success
    end

    Core->>NFT: mint-cancellation-receipt(sender, stream-id)
    NFT-->>Core: NFT minted

    Core-->>Sender: {vested, unvested}
```

**Cancellation Logic:**
```clarity
;; Calculate amounts at cancellation
(let ((elapsed-blocks (- block-height (get start-block stream)))
      (total-duration (- (get end-block stream) (get start-block stream))))
  (let ((vested (/ (* (get amount stream) elapsed-blocks) total-duration))
        (already-withdrawn (get withdrawn stream)))
    (let ((remaining-vested (- vested already-withdrawn))
          (unvested (- (get amount stream) vested)))
      ;; Return unvested to sender
      ;; Keep vested for recipient to withdraw
    )))
```

### Read-Only Functions

```clarity
;; Get stream details
(define-read-only (get-stream (stream-id uint))
  (map-get? streams {stream-id: stream-id}))

;; Get withdrawable amount
(define-read-only (get-withdrawable-amount (stream-id uint))
  ;; Implementation shown above
)

;; Get stream count
(define-read-only (get-stream-count)
  (var-get stream-id-nonce))

;; Check if stream is active
(define-read-only (is-stream-active (stream-id uint))
  (let ((stream (unwrap! (get-stream stream-id) false)))
    (and (not (get cancelled stream))
         (>= block-height (get start-block stream))
         (< block-height (get end-block stream)))))
```

## Contract 4: bitpay-nft

Non-transferable Claim NFTs minted as receipts when streams complete or are cancelled.

### NFT Structure

```clarity
;; SIP-009 Trait Implementation
(impl-trait .sip-009-trait.nft-trait)

(define-non-fungible-token claim-nft uint)

(define-map token-metadata
  uint
  {
    stream-id: uint,
    recipient: principal,
    event-type: (string-ascii 20), ;; "completed" or "cancelled"
    amount-claimed: uint,
    minted-at: uint
  }
)
```

### Minting Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Stream Event] --> B{Event Type?}
    B -->|Withdrawal| C[Check if final]
    B -->|Cancellation| D[Mint Cancellation NFT]

    C --> E{Stream Completed?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Mint Completion NFT]
    E -->|No| G[No NFT]

    F --> H[Store Metadata]
    D --> H
    H --> I[Emit Event]

    style A fill:#e1f5ff
    style F fill:#d4f4dd
    style D fill:#ffe1e1
```

**Key Characteristic:** These NFTs are **non-transferable** - they serve as permanent receipts.

## Contract 5: bitpay-obligation-nft

Transferable Stream Obligation NFTs representing the recipient's right to withdraw from a stream.

### NFT Structure

```clarity
(impl-trait .sip-009-trait.nft-trait)

(define-non-fungible-token stream-obligation uint)

(define-map token-owners uint principal)
(define-map token-uri uint (string-ascii 256))
```

### Transfer Mechanism

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Seller
    actor Buyer
    participant NFT as obligation-nft
    participant Core as bitpay-core

    Seller->>NFT: transfer(token-id, seller, buyer)
    NFT->>NFT: Verify owner
    NFT->>Core: Verify stream exists & active
    Core-->>NFT: Confirmed

    NFT->>NFT: Update owner mapping
    NFT->>NFT: Emit transfer event
    NFT-->>Buyer: Ownership transferred

    Note over Buyer,Core: Buyer can now withdraw
    Buyer->>Core: withdraw-from-stream(stream-id)
    Core->>NFT: Verify buyer owns NFT
    NFT-->>Core: Confirmed
    Core->>Buyer: Transfer vested amount
```

**Key Characteristic:** These NFTs **can be transferred**, enabling a marketplace for future income streams.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

Each contract has comprehensive unit tests covering:

```clarity
;; Test: Stream creation
(define-test create-stream-success
  ;; Verify stream created with correct parameters
  ;; Verify sBTC transferred
  ;; Verify NFT minted
  ;; Verify fee collected
)

(define-test create-stream-invalid-amount
  ;; Verify error when amount = 0
)

;; Test: Withdrawal
(define-test withdraw-partial
  ;; Advance to 50% duration
  ;; Verify 50% withdrawable
)

(define-test withdraw-full
  ;; Advance past end block
  ;; Verify 100% withdrawable
)

;; Test: Cancellation
(define-test cancel-stream-midway
  ;; Cancel at 30% duration
  ;; Verify 30% to recipient
  ;; Verify 70% to sender
)
```

### Integration Tests

```clarity
;; Test: Complete stream lifecycle
(define-test full-stream-lifecycle
  ;; 1. Create stream
  ;; 2. Partial withdrawal
  ;; 3. List on marketplace
  ;; 4. Purchase by new user
  ;; 5. Final withdrawal by new owner
  ;; 6. Verify all state transitions
)

;; Test: Treasury governance
(define-test treasury-proposal-flow
  ;; 1. Admin creates proposal
  ;; 2. Multiple admins approve
  ;; 3. Execute withdrawal
  ;; 4. Verify balance updated
)
```

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Line Coverage:** >90%
- **Branch Coverage:** >85%
- **Function Coverage:** 100%
